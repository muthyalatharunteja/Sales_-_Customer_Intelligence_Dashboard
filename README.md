# 📊 Retail Sales & Customer Intelligence Dashboard

End-to-end Business Intelligence dashboards built using Tableau and Excel to analyze retail sales performance, profitability, and customer behavior.

This project transforms 64K+ raw retail transactions into executive KPIs and interactive dashboards that support data-driven business decisions around revenue growth, customer retention, and margin optimization.

## 🚀 Objective

Retail transaction data was stored in multiple raw files with no centralized reporting.

The goal was to design an interactive BI solution that helps answer:

- What drives revenue vs profit?
- Which customers generate the most value?
- Where are margins being eroded?
- How does performance trend over time?

## 📂 Dataset Overview

- 64,105 transaction-level sales records
- 1,000 customers
- Multiple orders across 2 years
- Separate customer, order, and sales datasets

The data required cleaning, transformation, and KPI engineering before analysis.
