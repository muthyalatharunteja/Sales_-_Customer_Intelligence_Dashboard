# 📊 Retail Sales & Customer Intelligence Dashboard

End-to-end Business Intelligence dashboards built using Tableau and Excel to analyze retail sales performance, profitability, and customer behavior.

This project transforms 64K+ raw retail transactions into executive KPIs and interactive dashboards that enable data-driven decisions around revenue growth, customer retention, and margin optimization.

---

## 🚀 Business Objective

Retail data was stored across multiple raw files with limited reporting and no centralized visibility into performance.

Stakeholders needed a solution to quickly understand:

- What drives revenue vs profit?
- Which customers generate the most value?
- Where are margins being lost?
- How does performance trend over time?

The goal was to design interactive dashboards to support faster and smarter decision-making for sales managers and leadership.
